### Week 8 &mdash; Rotational/Internal Kinetic Energy &mdash; This Finishes Conservation Laws

* Thursday, Oct. 30 &mdash; Study Chapter C11 &mdash; The derivation culminating in Eq. C11.14 is the central result showing that we can divide up the total kinetic energy into C.o.M. K.E. and internal K.E. &mdash; The latter is very often, but not necessarily, rotational kinetic energy &mdash; It can also be pulsations or any other internal motion &mdash; Problem Set 11: 1. Re-do Problem 3 on [Exam 1](./exams/Exam1.nb.pdf) where a rod was modeled as 20 equal masses, *but this time compute the kinetic energy* 2. C11B.6; 3. C11B.8; 4. C11M.7 
  
### Week 9 &mdash; Newton's Laws &mdash; Forces From Motion (By Taking Derivatives of Position)

* Monday, Nov. 3 &mdash; Study Chapter N1 &mdash; Problem Set 12: 1. N1M.3; 2. N1M.4; 3. N1D.2 (you can use the result of N1D.1); 4. N1R.3 &mdash; I find that [my diagram for circular motion scaling](./resources/CircularMotionScaling.pdf) is both more exact and less complex than Moore's Fig. N1.6
* Thursday, Nov. 6 &mdash; Study Chapter N2 &mdash; Problem Set 13: 1. N2B.4; 2. N2B.8; 3. N2M.5; 4. N2M.8; 5. N2R.3

### Week 10 &mdash; Motion from Forces (By Doing Integrals of Acceleration) &mdash; Statics

* Monday, Nov. 10 &mdash; Review (if needed) Appendix NB on integral calculus, and then study Chapter N3 &mdash; Problem Set 14: 1. N3M.6; 2. N3D.4; 3. Use the same setup as N3D.4, except this time find *a<sub>x</sub>(t)*; 4. N3R.1; 5. N3R.2
* Presentations for Monday:
    * *NB:* Moore is being uncharacteristically sloppy in quite a few places where he neglects to put the parenthesis in *(&Delta;&thinsp;t)*&thinsp;<sup>2</sup> &mdash; don't succumb to this sloppiness in your presentations below
    * Grace: Newton had astronomical data for the average Earth-Moon distance and the period of the Moon's orbit around the Earth which is 27.3 days (not the usually-quoted 29.5 days) &mdash; Demonstrate, as Newton did, that there is consistency between the downward acceleration of objects near the Earth's surface, and the centripetal acceleration of the Moon as it proceeds around its approximately circular orbit (note, they are not identical, and also, you need equation N2.4a to demonstrate consistency)
	* Sasha: I will provide you with a numerical integration example for a problem involving a constant accelerating force *and* a drag force that increases with velocity (such problems can often only be solved numerically, so only in special cases will you find them on problem sets or exams) &mdash; Here is an HTML version of a Jupyter notebook I built for another class: [Home Run with Air Resistance](./resources/HomeRunWithAirResistance.ipynb.html) &mdash; If you want the Jupyter notebook instead of the HTML version of the notebook, just knock the .html extension off of the URL
	* Sam: Can you lead us through something like Example 3.5, but for several steps of the elliptical orbit of Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN)? We can make it a worksheet that you lead everybody through &mdash; Start of a worksheet is [here](./resources/CometSwan.pdf)
	* Brian: I will prep you for some of the material coming in N4, by discussing the two fundamental principles of statics, which are (1) balancing of forces, and (2) balancing of torques &mdash; Then I will do Example N4.5 that requires application of both principles to get a solution
* Thursday, Nov. 13 &mdash; Study Chapter N4, which won't be on Monday, Nov 17th's exam &mdash; You can bring any review topics you want to discuss from Chapters C8-C11 and N1-N3 and/or I can be available for Q&A at multiple times on Saturday &mdash; Problem Set 15 on Chapter N4: Forthcoming

### Week 11 &mdash; Exam 2 &mdash; Linearly-Constrained Motion

* Monday, Nov. 17 &mdash; Exam 2, covering Moore Chapters C8-C11 and N1-N3
* *NB:* I'd like to move the Thursday, Nov. 20 to Wednesday Nov. 19, provided there isn't some big Wednesday event that that conflicts with
* Thursday, Nov. 20 &mdash; Chapter N5 (on commonly-encountered linearly-constrained situations)

### Week 12

* Monday, Nov. 24 &mdash; Chapter N6

### Week 13

* Monday, Dec. 1 &mdash; Chapter N7
* Thursday, Dec. 4 &mdash; Chapter N8

### Week 14

* Monday, Dec. 8 &mdash; Chapter N9
* Thursday, Dec. 11 &mdash; Chapter N10

### Week 15

* Monday, Dec. 15 &mdash; Exam 3
* Thursday, Dec. 18 &mdash; Kepler's Laws &mdash; Following Chapter N11 of Moore &mdash; Or perhaps use [&ldquo;Feynman's Lost Lecture&rdquo;](https://dn710004.ca.archive.org/0/items/richard-feynman-pdf-library/Feynman%2C%20Richard%20%2837%20books%29/Feynman%27s%20Lost%20Lecture%20%5Bed.%20Goodstein%5D/Goodstein%2C%20D.%20%28ed.%29%20-%20Feynman%27s%20Lost%20Lecture%20%28Vintage%2C%201997%29.pdf) &mdash; The goal is to see how Kepler's Laws can be explained by Newton's Laws, which is one of Newton's definitive triumphs &mdash; Others in Newton's day had conjectures and incomplete arguments about a gravitational force law &mdash; Newton pushed his &ldquo;Law of Universal Gravitation&rdquo; through to an unambiguous conclusion that explained Brahe's, Kepler's and Galileo's work in a unifying sweep that has set the gold standard for all fields of science ever since
