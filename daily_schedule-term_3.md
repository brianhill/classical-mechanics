### Week 8 &mdash; Rotational/Internal Kinetic Energy &mdash; This Finishes Conservation Laws

* Thursday, Oct. 30 &mdash; Study Chapter C11 &mdash; The derivation culminating in Eq. C11.14 is the central result showing that we can divide up the total kinetic energy into C.o.M. K.E. and internal K.E. &mdash; The latter is very often, but not necessarily, rotational kinetic energy &mdash; It can also be pulsations or any other internal motion &mdash; Problem Set 11: 1. Re-do Problem 3 on [Exam 1](./exams/Exam1.nb.pdf) where a rod was modeled as 20 equal masses, *but this time compute the kinetic energy* 2. C11B.6; 3. C11B.8; 4. C11M.7 
  
### Week 9 &mdash; Newton's Laws &mdash; Forces From Motion (By Taking Derivatives of Position)

* Monday, Nov. 3 &mdash; Study Chapter N1 &mdash; Problem Set 12: 1. N1M.3; 2. N1M.4; 3. N1D.2 (you can use the result of N1D.1); 4. N1R.3
* Thursday, Nov. 6 &mdash; Study Chapter N2 &mdash; Problem Set 13: 1. N2B.4; 2. N2B.8; 3. N2M.5; 4. N2M.8; 5. N2R.3
* Chapter N2 and N3 Presentations for Thursday:
    * Sam: Lead people through a graphical exercise that begins with a mass *m*=2kg, and a motion of *x(t)=A* cos *&omega;t* with *A*=0.1m and *&omega;=2&pi;/T* and *T*=3s &mdash; They will start with a graph of position vs. time that shows a full 3-second cycle and then produce graphs of velocity vs. time and acceleration vs. time
	* Sasha: Lead people through a graphical exercise that solves N3B.1 &mdash; Extend the graphical exercise to get an *x*-position after they have gotten the *x*-velocity
    * Grace: Take the derivative of Equation N3.18 and show that a true result immediately emerges &mdash; Repeat for Equation N3.19 &mdash; This is an application of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (that the derivative of the integral gets you back the original function) &mdash; (An alternative Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is that the integral of the derivative gets you back the original function)
	* Brian: Take the derivative of the energy conservation equation for a particle moving in an arbitrary potential and show that a true result immediately emerges (this is an application of the vector calculus version of the chain rule)

### Week 10 &mdash; Motion from Forces (By Doing Integrals of Acceleration) &mdash; Exam 2

* Monday, Nov. 10 &mdash; Study Chapter N3 &mdash; Problem Set 14: Forthcoming
* Thursday, Nov. 13 &mdash; Study Chapter N4, which won't be on Monday the 17th's exam &mdash; Come prepared with any review topics you want to discuss from Chapters C8-C11 and N1-N3 &mdash; Problem Set 15 on Chapter N4: Forthcoming

### Week 11

* Monday, Nov. 17 &mdash; Exam 2, covering Moore Chapters C8-C11 and N1-N3
* Thursday, Nov. 20 &mdash; Chapter N5

### Week 12

* Monday, Nov. 24 &mdash; Chapter N6

### Week 13

* Monday, Dec. 1 &mdash; Chapter N7
* Thursday, Dec. 4 &mdash; Chapter N8

### Week 14

* Monday, Dec. 8 &mdash; Chapter N9
* Thursday, Dec. 11 &mdash; Chapter N10

### Week 15

* Monday, Dec. 15 &mdash; Exam 3
* Thursday, Dec. 18 &mdash; Kepler's Laws &mdash; Following Chapter N11 of Moore &mdash; Or perhaps use [&ldquo;Feynman's Lost Lecture&rdquo;](https://dn710004.ca.archive.org/0/items/richard-feynman-pdf-library/Feynman%2C%20Richard%20%2837%20books%29/Feynman%27s%20Lost%20Lecture%20%5Bed.%20Goodstein%5D/Goodstein%2C%20D.%20%28ed.%29%20-%20Feynman%27s%20Lost%20Lecture%20%28Vintage%2C%201997%29.pdf) &mdash; The goal is to see how Kepler's Laws can be explained by Newton's Laws, which is one of Newton's definitive triumphs &mdash; Others in Newton's day had conjectures and incomplete arguments about a gravitational force law &mdash; Newton pushed his &ldquo;Law of Universal Gravitation&rdquo; through to an unambiguous conclusion that explained Brahe's, Kepler's and Galileo's work in a unifying sweep that has set the gold standard for all fields of science ever since
