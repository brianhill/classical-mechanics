## Daily Schedule - Term 3

### Week 8 &mdash; Begin Newton's Laws

* Thursday, Oct. 30 &mdash; Study Chapter N1 &mdash; Problem Set 12: 1. N1M.3; 2. N1M.4; 3. N1D.2 (you can use the result of N1D.1); 4. N1R.3 (the job here is to compare the acceleration required to brake to a halt vs. the acceleration required to swerve, and if you find one is less than the other, you are done analyzing the problem, and that is what the driver should do)
* Presentations:
  * Grace: Present Exercise N1X.1 (and in addition, take a 2nd derivative to discover the object's acceleration, including its components, magnitude, and direction)
  * Sam: Show how Figure N1.6(b) illustrates the *1/r* in N1.17
  * Sasha: Show how Figure N1.6(c) illustrates the *v<sup>2</sup>* in N1.17
  * Brian: Take derivatives of *x(t)=A* cos *&omega;t* and *y(t)=A* sin *&omega;t* like Grace did to get the results that Sam and Sasha got
