## Daily Schedule Term 2

### Week 1 &mdash; Particles, Interactions, Momentum, and Relativistic Momentum &mdash; Coordinate Systems and Vectors

* Monday, Sept. 1 &mdash; Study all of Chapter C2 (we'll come back to Chapter 1 later) &mdash; Presentations: Choose a problem to present that illustrates Section C2.2 (Position, Velocity, and Derivatives), Luca; C2.3 (Vectors), Sasha (Brian did this one because Sasha's voice is out of commission); C2.4 (Momentum Conservation), Grace; C2.5 (Force and Weight), Hannah
* Thursday, Sept. 4 &mdash; Study all of Chapter C3 &mdash; Presentations: Choose a problem to present that illustrates C2.7 (Relativistic Momentum or Relativistic Momentum Transfer - C2D.1(e) might be a sufficient example, but I can help you think of others), Sam; C3.2 (Reference Frames), Luca; C3.3 (Displacement Vectors), Grace; C3.6 (Vectors in 2-D, where all vectors can be simply described by a magnitude and a single angle), Hannah &mdash; Five Chapter C2 problems to turn in at beginning of class: C2B.4 (you can make the copy if the figure just by redrawing the figure reasonably closely to the original), C2B.11, C2M.2 (will someone please share the PDF with all of us so that we can easily print out copies of Figure C2.11 at a large size rather than enlarging it on the photocopier?), C2M.6 (I assume he chose the 3's, 4's, and 5's that appear in this problem to take advantage of the 3-4-5 Pythagorean triple, and we'll see whether that is true when we solve it - BTW, 5-12-13 is another commonly used triple when setting up physics examples to work out neatly), C2R.1
