## Daily Schedule - Term 2

### Week 1 &mdash; Particles, Interactions, Momentum, &mdash; Coordinate Systems and Vectors

* Monday, Sept. 1 &mdash; Study Chapter C2
* Thursday, Sept. 4 &mdash; Study Chapter C3 &mdash; Problem Set 1: C2B.4, C2B.11, C2M.2, C2M.6, C2R.1

### Week 2 &mdash; Center of Mass

* Monday, Sept. 8 &mdash; Study Chapter C4 &mdash; Problem Set 2:
    1. C3M.2 (making a nice diagram with each of the small squares on the engineering paper representing 0.01Tm is a good way to start)
	2. C3M.3 (Mauna Kea on the horizon)
	3. C3M.5 (good 2-D trig practice - make sure whatever calculator you use is in degrees mode)
	4. C3D.1 (properties of vector addition)
	5. C3R.2 (good 3-D trig practice that Hannah did most of in class - and again, make sure your calculator is in degrees mode whenever you are answering in degrees)

* Presentations for Sept. 8 on Chapter C4 (choose a problem or a derivation that illustrates the material of the following sections):
    * C4.2 - Sam - the definition of Center of Mass, define it, and then apply it
    * C4.3 - Sasha - this section contains a critical derivation, which you should reproduce for everyone
    * C4.4 - Grace - inertial frames - there is a lovely discussion by Galileo on this - Google for Galileo, butterflies, and fish, and you will come upon the discussion, published in *Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems* - original in Italian
    * C4.5 - Hannah - freely floating frames - such as a falling elevator
    * C4.6 - Luca - When and why can we neglect or presume something about the interaction with Earth, an object whose mass is about 6x10<sup>24</sup>kg, and which thereby dwarfs any other object whose mass we might interact with? - Is the Earth receiving any impulse when its gravity is imparting impulse on something, such as a dropped brick?
